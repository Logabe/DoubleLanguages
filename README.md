# DoubleLanguages
A Celeste Mod for learning languages!

## Features
- Use two languages at once in cutscenes! The 'second language' cutscene will play first.
- Can be enabled or disabled from the main menu.

## package.sh
Running this file will package a build into a .ZIP file for distribution.

## TODO
- Add translation to more entities.
- Translate each line individually rather than the whole cutscene.
- Upload to GameBanana
- Organise the code better haha
